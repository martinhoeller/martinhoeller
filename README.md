### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a freelance developer based in Berlin, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. Since 2005 I mostly work on projects for Apple's platforms (iOS / iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS). I also have several of my own apps on the various App Stores, most prominently [In Your Face](https://inyourface.app) and [Tracktiq](https://www.tracktiq.com).

Don't hesitate to contact me if you think I could support your company or project!
